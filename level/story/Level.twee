In the place where I'm from, we wouldn't be having this conversation because there is no you or I.

:: Well [Well sign] {"position":"4325,1300","size":"100,100"}
There's a ladder going down, but you cannot see the bottom.

[[Climb down]]
[[Step back]]


:: What battle? {"position":"1975,2675","size":"100,100"}
You're really not from around here, are you? My people have been at war since before I was born.


:: What do you know about that knight? {"position":"2100,2425","size":"100,100"}
Well, I know he's not from around here. There was a battle. Then he showed up.

[[What do you mean he showed up?]]
[[What battle?]]


:: What do you mean he showed up? {"position":"2175,2900","size":"100,100"}
I mean he arrived on foot, without a weapon and covered in blood. We thought he left the battle to raid our village. But he had a letter from the Sheikh.

[[What did the letter say?|what-did-letter-say]]
[[Who is the Sheikh?|nazar-who-shiekh]]


:: What is he guarding you from? {"position":"2500,3250","size":"100,100"}
You'll have to ask him.


:: What's new? {"position":"1825,2425","size":"100,100"}
Not much.


:: When does the knight leave? {"position":"2075,3250","size":"100,100"}



:: Where are you from? {"position":"2675,1750","size":"100,100"}
A different place. Your language lacks the words for it.

[[Give it a shot.]]


:: Who is the Sheikh? {"position":"1225,2000","size":"100,100"}
<<set $knightOpts.whoSheikh to false>>

He sent me here to guard the town.

<<knight-choices>>


:: Why are you guarding this town? {"position":"1075,2000","size":"100,100"}
<<set $knightOpts.whyTown to false>>

The Sheikh asked me to. That's all I can tell you.

The Sheikh created this village.

[[So what did the letter say?|what-did-letter-say]]


:: no-map {"position":"700,1875","size":"100,100"}



:: observe-what {"position":"3200,1750","size":"100,100"}
I was told this village would be getting a new visitor.

[[I'm...new here]]
[[Oh you mean the knight?]]


:: seek-what {"position":"2875,1750","size":"100,100"}
A map...

[[What's so special about a map?|special-map]]
[[You said you were observing? What?|observe-what]]


:: silence {"position":"475,1250","size":"100,100"}
...

[[*ahem*... I said 'Hi'|silence]]
[[Bye|bye-silence]]


:: special-map {"position":"2975,2050","size":"100,100"}
Find it for me and I'll show you.


:: what-did-letter-say {"position":"2225,3075","size":"100,100"}
It said "Give food and water to this soldier. In return he will guard the village." It had the Sheikh's seal. It was unmistakable.

[[How long ago was this?]]
[[When does the knight leave?]]
[[What is he guarding you from?]]

<<set $learnedKnightStory to true>>


:: what-knight {"position":"2500,2700","size":"100,100"}
There's a knight to the south. He doesn't talk much. Go see for yourself.


:: who-fire {"position":"2850,1550","size":"100,100"}
A fellow traveller.... I'm here to seek and observe.

[[Where are you from?]]
[[Observe what?|observe-what]]
[[What are you seeking?|seek-what]]


:: yes-knight {"position":"2700,2700","size":"100,100"}
I see... let me know if you need anything. I'm here to help.
